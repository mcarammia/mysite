Some years ago I developed an interest in forecasting certain social processes. Indeed between 2015-2019 I was hired at EASO (the EU Asylum Agency) to launch and coordinate a research programme aimed (among other things) at forecasting asylum-related migration in Europe. This is a big scientific challenge, but one that can improve the functioning of asylum systems. I have been working on this project with some colleagues within and outside of EASO. Among the latter, Jakub Bijak and his team and (particularly) Stefano Iacus. The main outputs of this project (so far) include a couple of papers.

Recently Stefano and I are exploring the potential of our methodology to also forecast other social processes, and namely international conflicts and their fatalities. We partnered with Fulvio Attin√† and took part to an international forecasting competition. We did pretty well, considering that was our first adventure in that area! Our related paper is currently under review.

Still as part of my interest in forecasting, I am a member of the advisory board of QuantMig.

More project details will follow.
