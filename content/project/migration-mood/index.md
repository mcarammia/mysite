The *MigMood* project analyses the public mood toward migration at the level of mass public opinion -- the society at large. The movements of migration mood impact on the boundaries of social tolerance towards immigrants, and they also define the space of the desirable policy responses.

The project combines several data sources to generate quantitative time series of migration mood, both long-term (based on survey data) and short-term (based on Twitter). The analysis of migration mood focuses on both its determinants (for example, how does the public mood respond to immigration?) and its consequences (does the public mood have an impact on migration policies, and of what sort?).

Stefano Iacus is quite deeply involved in the project. Jim Stimson contributes as an advisor. We have presented working papers at some conferences and workshops, and are now turning them into submissions.

More project details will follow.
