  abstract = {The Routledge Handbook of European Public Policy provides an in-depth and systematic understanding of EU policies. It covers theoretical approaches on the policy process and the various stages of public policy formulation and decision making, and discusses key questions of contemporary European governance. The handbook introduces major concepts, trends, and methodologies in a variety of comparative settings thereby providing the first systematic effort to include theoretical and substantive analyses of European public policies in a single volume.  The handbook is divided into four sections:   Concepts and approaches in EU policymaking;  Substantive policies of the EU, including economic and social, fiscal and monetary, areas of freedom, security, and justice, and external policies;  Elements of the policy cycle;  Themes ranging from crisis and resistance to controversies in education.  This handbook will be an essential reference for students and scholars of the European Union, public policy, social policy, and more broadly for European and comparative politics.},
