Since January 2020, I am a Senior Researcher at the Department of Political and Social Sciences of the University of Catania, Italy.

Before joining the University of Catania, I have been working as a Senior Researcher at the European Asylum Support Office (EASO – the EU Asylum Agency), where I was responsible for the Agency’s Research programme on the push and pull factors of asylum-related migration. Previously I have been a Lecturer and then a Senior Lecturer at the University of Malta.

My research focuses mainly on the comparative analysis of institutions and public policies. I have a special interest in the interaction among migration dynamics, politics, and policy. I am a founding co-director of the [Italian Agendas Project](http://www.comparativeagendas.net/italy) and a principal investigator of the [EU Agendas Project](http://www.comparativeagendas.net/eu).
