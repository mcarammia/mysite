	abstract = {The European Council is the highest political body of the European Union and the main venue for setting the agenda on high politics. Using a new dataset of all content-coded European Council Conclusions issued between 1975 and 2010, we analyze the policy agenda of the European Council and test hypotheses on agenda change and diversity over time. We find that the theory of punctuated equilibrium applies to the agenda of the European Council, which exhibits a degree of kurtosis similar to that found in policy agendas of other institutions located at the juncture between input and output of the policy process. Throughout the 36-year period, agenda-setting dynamics involved both small changes and major shifts but also more frequent medium-sized negative changes than found elsewhere. Given capacity limits to the agenda, large expansions of attention to topics involved large cuts in attention. Cuts were more often medium in size in order to maintain some level of attention to the topics affected, even though issue disappearance from the European Council agenda has been frequent too. This relates to the functions of the European Council as venue for high politics, with expectations about issue attendance rising with increasing policy jurisdictions throughout the European integration process. Studying dynamics over time, we measured entropy to show how the agenda became more diverse but also displayed episodic concentration in an oscillating pattern. This can be accounted for by the nature of the European Council as a policy venue: increasing complexity of this institution pushed the members to produce a more diverse agenda, but capacity limits and the need to be responsive to incoming information led to concentration at specific time-points.},

Previous scholarship has focused almost exclusively on democratic governments, finding evidence of punctuated equilibria. Authoritarian regimes may behave differently, both because they may operate with fewer institutional barriers to choice and because they have fewer incentives to gather and respond to policy-relevant information coming from civil society. By analysing public budgeting in Brazil, Turkey, Malta and Russia before and after their transitions from or to democracy, we can test punctuated equilibrium theory under a variety of governing conditions. Our goal is to advance the understanding of the causes of budgetary instability by leveraging contextual circumstances to push the theory beyond democracies and assess its broader applicability.},

In this article, we argue that an analysis of agenda formation dynamics in the European Council may help us understand better how the European Council works and how its role has evolved over time. Building on theories of agenda-setting, we identify two ideal-typical modes of agenda formation: selective targeting and routine monitoring. Based on a comprehensive dataset of coded European Council Conclusions in the period 1975?2011, we show that the substantive content of the European Council agenda shows little change over time. However, in terms of agenda formation dynamics, we find a marked shift toward routine monitoring of issues. This supports the claim that the European Council is developing into the EU's de facto government.},

	abstract = {A number of early warning signals were identifiable in the years prior to the 2015/16 refugee surge in Europe, yet the world was
caught off-guard by mass migration movements from the Middle East and Africa. In the past, this has also been the case in the
context of most major geopolitical or environmental shocks. Capacity to anticipate all but directly-regulated migration flows appears
to be quite weak. The possibility for transit and destination countries to anticipate both forced and legal migration flows is however
critical in order to ensure effective management of asylum, migration and integration systems. Recently, some OECD and EU
countries have developed tools to predict short or longer-term migration trends or to assess migration uncertainties and risks, but
many countries still have quite limited capacities in this domain.
This edition of Migration Policy Debates presents the results of a stock-taking exercise of existing practices for better anticipating
different types of migration movements. It brings key lessons learnt from the joint EASO-OECD conference “From panic to planning:
unpacking the policy toolbox to anticipate migration trends” (Paris, June 2016) and presents lessons for improving information systems
to reinforce the preparedness of reception and management systems.},

They analyse a broad range of institutional and policy venues, including public opinion, political parties, the executive, the Parliament, and the Constitutional Court. While single articles address different research questions and focus on different institutions, they all share a focus on the dynamics of issue attention over time. This introduction provides a summary overview of the theoretical and methodological tools employed in the volume, highlighting how the study of policy agendas can contribute to the understanding of political systems and their change over time. It then summarises the main findings of single articles which, taken together, shed new light on several classic questions that have been widely debated in the literature on the evolution of the Italian political system.},

The analysis relies on data sets of the Italian Agendas Project recording the issue content of party manifestos and laws and covering the period 1983–2012. The results of time series cross-sectional models lend support to the presence of a mandate effect in Italy, a mechanism which was strengthened after the introduction of alternation in government. Opposition priorities may have an impact on the legislative agenda, but mostly when considering the legislation initiated in Parliament. Our findings have important implications for the understanding of the impact of government alternation, an institutional feature underlying – with varying intensity – most democracies, on the functioning of democratic representation.},

The good fit with the second-order election model marked Malta as Southern Europe's misfit.

From 1948 to 1994 the Christian Democratic Party was uninterruptedly in office, often in coalition, while the Communist Party remained the major opposition party. After the collapse of these parties, a new system based on the alternation between a centre-right and a centre-left coalition emerged. To date the Italian Policy Agendas Project has released six datasets covering party manifestos, parliamentary questions, investiture speeches, laws, decrees, and budgetary data. Through their analysis, it is possible to assess the elements of stability and change that characterized Italian politics since the mid-eighties as well as some recent evolutions such as the mediatization and personalization of politics, the crisis of mainstream parties, and the advent of anti-establishment and populist parties as key actors of the system.},

However, following the effective closure of the Central Mediterranean Route in 2018 and 2019, this correlation was no longer apparent, showing that the explanatory power of the Push Factor Index is dependent on enabling factors.},

	abstract = {Policy agendas studies analyse the dynamics of attention to policy issues over time and across actors and institutions to obtain insights into the functioning of political systems. The articles in this special issue draw on this approach to investigate key aspects of the Italian political system, with a special emphasis on the period spanning from the political crisis of the early 1990s to the watershed elections of 2013. They analyse a broad range of institutional and policy venues, including public opinion, political parties, the executive, the Parliament, and the Constitutional Court. While single articles address different research questions and focus on different institutions, they all share a focus on the dynamics of issue attention over time. This introduction provides a summary overview of the theoretical and methodological tools employed in the volume, highlighting how the study of policy agendas can contribute to the understanding of political systems and their change over time. It then summarises the main findings of single articles which, taken together, shed new light on several classic questions that have been widely debated in the literature on the evolution of the Italian political system.},

	abstract = {The effects of the so-called "refugee crisis" of 2015-16 continue to dominate much of the European political agenda. Migration flows were sudden and unexpected, exposing significant shortcomings in the field of migration forecasting and leaving governments and NGOs unprepared. Migration is a complex system typified by episodic variation, underpinned by causal factors that are interacting, highly context dependent and short-lived. Correspondingly, migration nowcasts rely on scattered low-quality data and much-needed forecasts are local and inconsistent. Here we describe a data-driven adaptive system for forecasting asylum applications in the European Union (EU), built on machine learning algorithms that combine administrative data with non-traditional data sources at scale. We exploit three tiers of data: geolocated events and internet searches in countries of origin, detections at the EU external border, and asylum recognition rates in the EU, to effectively forecast individual asylum-migration flows up to four weeks ahead with high accuracy. Uniquely our approach a) models individual country-to-country migration flows; b) detects migration drivers early onset; c) anticipates lagged effects; d) estimates the effect of individual drivers; and e) describes how patterns of drivers shift over time. This is, to our knowledge, the first comprehensive system for forecasting asylum applications based on an unsupervised algorithm and data at scale. Importantly, this approach can be extended to forecast other migration social-economic indicators.},

					El establecimiento de la agenda es un proceso selectivo en el que los asuntos ganan la atención de los formuladores de políticas (policy-makers) y se les atribuye prioridad. Dentro del contexto de la UE se han aplicado dos grandes marcos teóricos para estudiar este proceso —uno basado en la elección racional y otro en la racionalidad limitada—. La investigación en el primer ámbito se ha centrado en los actores y el poder de configuración de la agenda (de carácter condicional), mientras que el segundo ha hecho más hincapié en las restricciones cognitivas, institucionales y externas al procesamiento de la información. Dentro de este último las teorías importantes han sido: 1) la teoría de corrientes múltiples; y 2) la teoría del equilibrio interrumpido. Respecto al enfoque empírico del establecimiento de agenda de la UE , podemos distinguir dos ámbitos. Los análisis de actores o escenarios intentan clarificar las relaciones de poder y la composición de agenda dentro de las instituciones. Los análisis de asuntos específicos (o las áreas de las políticas públicas) rastrean el camino que sigue un tema determinado en la agenda. Respecto a las principales características del sistema político en relación al establecimiento de agenda, algunas características destacadas son la coexistencia de rutas formales e informales de acceso, la competición entre niveles de jurisdicción, y diferentes rutas de configuración de agenda en relación a los principales escenarios de la acción política. De esta manera, el campo de configuración de agenda es rico tanto en marcos de análisis como en aproximaciones metodológicas.Recibido: 19 mayo 2016Aceptado: 21 junio 2016Publicación en línea: 31 octubre 2016},

	abstract = {Asylum-related migration is highly complex, uncertain, and volatile, which precludes using standard model-based predictions to inform policy and operational decisions. At the same time, asylum's potentially high societal impacts on receiving countries and the resource implications of asylum processes call for more proactive approaches for assessing current and future migration flows. In this article, we propose an alternative approach to asylum modeling, based on the detection of early warning signals by using models originating from statistical control theory. Our empirical analysis of several asylum flows into Europe in 2010–2016 demonstrates the approach's utility and potential in aiding the management of mixed migration flows, while also shedding more light on the work needed to make better use of the “big data” and scenario-based methods for comprehensive and systematic examination of risk, uncertainty, and emerging trends.},
